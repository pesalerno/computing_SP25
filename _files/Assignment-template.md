Assignment Week 1 | Command line in the shell
--------------------------


>NAME: Patricia Salerno

For this assignment, you simply have to go through the code on [Chapter 4 of Haddock and Dunn](https://practicalcomputing.org/), and make sure you add

	lines of code using tab 

And right after the line of code, you have to tell me something about what you got (either writing it or copy/pasting the output here). And also describe what you are doing either before or after the code. You can add specific `commands` while typing in a sentence, and you can add comments just like I did above with your name. 

There is not much to do in **Markdown** in general... it's just *great practice to ALWAYS have clean, annotated, organized code*, so it's never too soon to start with that. 


---------
>In terms of the first two assignments, this is the backbone of the markdown document you need to submit - nothing much. So, don't get too fancy with Markdown, just use it to make your code look neat. You can: 
>
>- make lists
>
>- but it's not needed
>
>- the only requirement is that all lines of code are either like `this` within text or in their own line of code, like above.
