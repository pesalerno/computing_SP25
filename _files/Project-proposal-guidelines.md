## GUIDELINES FOR THE PROJECT PROPOSALS/PITCHES:


First, think about what the main question/aim will be for your project. It can be focused on MANY things! For examples of coding-heavy project ideas: 

- Creating a program that parses/edits sequence files or large data sheets 

- Making a program that searches, downloads, and parses/organizes bibliographic references

- Running through a genotyping pipeline with the sample data we have used

- Doing mass downloads and comparisons (BLAST) of GenBank sequence data

- Visualizing/graphing complex datasets/projects


You could also have a more conceptually-focused aim to your project (rather than coding), such that the "bulk" of the project is research/review oriented, 
and you only do a bit of coding.  


### Proposal format

The project proposals should look like this: 

1. **Background and justification** (why) - 4-8 sentences

2. **Question/aim** (what) - 2-3 sentences

3. **Summary of procedures/methods to use** (how) - try to either outline or make a flow-chart type graph where you detail how STDIN and STDOUT will be piped/transferred from one program/utility to another (if using many) and/or to outline the main portions of your code.

> If you have any details of how you would like to manage your program/pipeline, you can submit a markdown document together with your proposal.

### Proposal due date and discussions

SUBMIT YOUR PROJECT PROPOSALS by the end of the day on Wednesday March 26th at midnight.>>> **PLEASE SEND THE PROPOSALS TO MY EMAIL.**


We will discuss these proposals individually during lab time on thursday afternoon - I will read them all ahead of time. The focus of my questions/comments will be on feasibility and effort (is it too little? too much?).
