Assignment Week 2 | Viewing and moving large files
--------------------------


>NAME: 


### 


> **TASK 1:** First, generate a list of all sequence data files, and save that into a new document ending with `.txt`. Then, use the `cat` command to visualize it.


	insert code here 

Explain your code either step by step, or with a short and clear summary of what you did in various steps. 

	#don't forget to copy/paste all relevant outputs

>sometimes it's neat to add comments like this too, or lines to separate things

--------------

> **TASK 2:** Now, make a new directory called `merged_pops` and copy (*don't move!*) all the data files into that new directory, using a single line of code and using wildcard (`*`) completion. 

	code #with comments/results/etc


> **TASK 3:** Now, move into the directory you copied the files into, and merge individuals from the same population using `cat` and `>`. You can use a separate command for each file merge, or using a single line with the use of `*`. Do `ls` with appropriate arguments (using `-flags`) to check your work. ***Make sure you name your files well (!!)***. 

	code #with comments/results/etc


> **TASK 4:** Finally, find two separate ways of counting the number of sequences/reads in each of the three merged sequence files. At least one of those ways must make use of `grep`. Copy your outputs and paste into a Markdown Table such as the one below: 


| merged file | # reads |
| ---- | ---- |
| population 1 | number-reads | 
| population 2 | number-reads | 
| population 3 | number-reads | 



And never forget to add your

	code #with comments/results/etc!!
