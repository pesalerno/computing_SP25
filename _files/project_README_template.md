# Project title

## Author: 


## Abstract (10 points)

Here, write a very short (4-5 sentence) description of what you did and what you found. Please begin and/or end with a brief context/justification of why your project was done. 


## Introduction (25 points)

Here, write a brief introduction (3-4 paragraphs) of your chosen methodology/theme for your independent study. Try to write this for as general a public as possible - as in, try to avoid jargon as much as possible, and define it when not possible to omit. 

## Methods/Results (65 points)

Here is the bulk of your project, and where you will add all of your code, the explanations of what each line of code does, and also you will add any relevant results as you walk us through your lines of code. For this last part (results) it may be important to either copy/paste output from the screen, or to link to an image for viewing. 

> Make sure that you include everything that is relevant, not only to understand your project fully, but also to be able to replicate it, if deemed necessary. It should include all lines of code that were used to produce the final results, and potentially some that were deleted or modified, whenever relevant for the narrative. For both this aspect of the project, and for the presentation, the 'process' is almost as important - if not more important - than the end result itself.
