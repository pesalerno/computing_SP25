# Week 4 | Regular Expressions

------------
>Week's goals:

>- Regular expressions

>- Genome assembly and libraries

## Genome assemblies and next-gen sequencing

Genome assemblies are not straightforward - even when you have a reference genome. this is because of the very messy nature of next generation data.

This week, we are understanding a bit more about genome assembly, and about next-generation library protocols, so on **thursday am** we will be discussing this paper:

>Please answer the following questions associated to the paper, prior to thursday's 8:30am lecture:
>
> - What is the general aim/goal/question of the study?
>
> - In your own words, try to explain how they obtained sequence data and how they assembled it (section 2.2)
> 
> - Very generally, what did they find? Anything in particular you found interesting in the results or study system?

## Take-home `grep` puzzles

For this week, we will have two `grep` problems to solve. 

- **First problem.** Here, we have a [data file](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/boana-ALL.plink.map) that has columns separated by tabs, and a lot of lines. It looks like this:

>Now, we want to only keep three columns: the first column will contain the number that precedes the underscore `_` (which is the SNP ID), the second column will contain the number that comes directly after the underscore (which is the SNP position), and the third column will contain the last number (which is the chromosome position). The three columns should all be separated by tabs.


- **Second problem.** In this [second file](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/birds-maryland_c.txt), we have a list of birds form Maryland, and we want to organize it such that we keep only:  a first column with the full common name, and a second column with the species name in the format *G. species* (rather than *Genus species* fully spelled out).

>When you turn in your homework, all you have to do is give me the full and final find/replace arguments you used, and what you got as an output. Save those into a .md document, and put them in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a7IY7lzPm3RFbbPA_fMFw-_bE958I6Nq?usp=drive_link).

>
>NOTE: make sure you refer to the book chapters 2 and 3, and also the appendix which has many `grep` shortcuts that will help you solve this take-home assignment.
