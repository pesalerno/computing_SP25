# Week 4 | Regular Expressions

------------
>Week's goals: 
>
>- Regular expressions
>
>- Genome assembly and libraries

--------------

## Genome assemblies and next-gen sequencing

Genome assemblies are not straightforward - even when you have a reference genome. this is because of the very messy nature of next generation data.

This week, we are understanding a bit more about genome assembly, and about next-generation library protocols, so on **thursday am** we will be discussing this paper:

>Please answer the following questions associated to the paper, prior to thursday's 8:30am lecture:
>
> - What is the general aim/goal/question of the study?
>
> - In your own words, try to explain how they obtained sequence data and how they assembled it (section 2.2)
> 
> - Very generally, what did they find? Anything in particular you found interesting in the results or study system?
