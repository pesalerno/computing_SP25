## Genome assemblies and next-gen sequencing

Genome assemblies are not straightforward - even when you have a reference genome. this is because of the very messy nature of next generation data.

This week, we are understanding a bit more about genome assembly, and about next-generation library protocols, so on **thursday am** we will be discussing this paper:

>Please answer the following questions associated to the paper, prior to thursday's 8:30am lecture:
>
> - What is the general aim/goal/question of the study?
>
> - In your own words, try to explain how they obtained sequence data and how they assembled it (section 2.2)
> 
> - Very generally, what did they find? Anything in particular you found interesting in the results or study system?

## Take-home `grep` puzzles

For this week, we will have two `grep` problems to solve. 

1. Here, we have a [data file](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/boana-ALL.plink.map) that has columns separated by tabs, and a lot of lines. It looks like this:

>Now, we want to only keep three columns: the first column will contain the number that precedes the underscore `_` (which is the SNP ID), the second column will contain the number that comes directly after the underscore (which is the SNP position), and the last number (which is the chromosome position). 


2. In this [second file](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/birds-maryland_c.txt), we have a list of birds form Maryland, and we want to organize it such that we keep only:
