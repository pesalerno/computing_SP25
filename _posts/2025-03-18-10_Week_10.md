## Starting out with github

`github` is an online colalbortive platform and repository (cloud-based storage) of coding and programming contributions. Everything is open source, and its intention is to make not only code but collaborations freely available. As biologists, you will likely encounter many programs that you will download and install/compile through github, as it is the most commonly used repository for open-source code. 

> An important thing to understand about github is that it's a very powerful **version control** software. *Do you use any version control software?* 

Today, we will create a github account, create our first repository, and then make our first `commit` and `push` to the repositories, or `repos` we just made. 

- To get started, first go to the github site and [create your account](https://github.com/signup) (user, password, etc). 

- Second, we will [install github command line using the instructions on this site](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).



- Third, we will create our fist repository online - make sure that you create it using a `README` file, and that it's open (see image below):

- Finally, we will start working with command line github and do our first git lines of code: 

```git
git init
git clone www.repo.com/address/here
git status

## now edit your README file using nano, and save your changes

git status
git add README.md
git commit -m 'my first commit'
git push origin main
```
