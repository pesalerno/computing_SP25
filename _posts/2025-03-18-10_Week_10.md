## Starting out with github

`github` is an online colalbortive platform and repository (cloud-based storage) of coding and programming contributions. Everything is open source, and its intention is to make not only code but collaborations freely available. As biologists, you will likely encounter many programs that you will download and install/compile through github, as it is the most commonly used repository for open-source code. 

> An important thing to understand about github is that it's a very powerful **version control** software. *Do you use any version control software?* 

Today, we will create a github account, create our first repository, and then make our first `commit` and `push` to the repositories, or `repos` we just made. 

- To get started, first go to the github site and [create your account](https://github.com/signup) (user, password, etc). 

- Second, we will [install github command line using the instructions on this site](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).



- Third, we will create our fist repository online - make sure that you create it using a `README` file, and that it's open (see image below): 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/new-repo.png?raw=true)

- Finally, we will start working with command line github and do our first git lines of code: 

```git
git init
git clone www.repo.com/address/here
git status

## now edit your README file using nano, and save your changes

git status
git add README.md
git commit -m 'my first commit'
git push origin main
``` 

## Thursday am | more git 	

### Resolving conflicts | local vs online

**It's important to mention again:** whenever there is a conflict between versions (as in, changes either within or among documents), the online version will always be favored over the local, as that has already been `committed` and `pushed`. So, be careful with making changes concurrently at the local and online level, as it can lead to **local data loss**. 


### Adding files and images 

Let's open `shell` and create a new directory where we will create a file to paste an old class assignment. 

>First, **let's make sure we are within the github repository folder** - if in doubt, do `git clone` with your repository web address, and `cd` into the repository folder after it downloads. 

```bash
mkdir files
nano assignment.md
```

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/first-file.png?raw=true)


Add an image to the online repository: 

```bash
git status
git add
git commit -m 'first image'
```

>> For an image to add, re-run your code and get a screenshot of the results, otherwise you can retrieve an old screenshot, and add the screenshot to the `files` directory. 

Then, substitute the full link to the file within the below code: 

```markdown
![](https://github.com/username/reponame/files/filename.png?raw=true)
```

>> *you can click on the file in your online repository to copy/paste the full link*. 

### Resolving conflicts | collaborating


So far, we have only worked on the main branch on git - no need to branch off work when not collaborating, even when collaborating with a single person (See a simple [two-person collaborative protocol here](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/git-collaborating-protocol.md)). However, things get very complicated with large teams of developers working on the same project. 

## Proposal submissions and sign-ups 

Please remember to follow these [guidelines](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/Project-proposal-guidelines.md) for the proposal submissions, and **remember to submit your proposals by midnight of wednesday March 26th!** 

>> **PLEASE [SIGN UP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WapIkuJmIZ0K86BTWX4E3sWrf8tdssYZj35ejVOeG5E/edit?usp=drive_link) for a time slot** (*20 minutes each session, first come first serve*) to have the proposal discussions during the thursday afternoon lab session.
