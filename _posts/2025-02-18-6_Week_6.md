# Week 6 | Last bash coding and Intro to python

## Assignment: transforming a file from fastq to fasta format in the shell

In the last weeks, we've been learning a lot about scripting and command line using the shell environment. We have also been learning a bit about genomics data, Illumina, and Genotyping by Sequencing library protocols. The main take-home assignment for this week (though there will be another one! so beware...) will be to create a short program, using tools that you have already seen in class, in order to create a `fastq` to `fasta` format converter. What does this mean? Well, as we've seen in class, the fastq format (when unzipped!) looks like this: 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/fastq.png?raw=true)


This file format has lots of information about quality, but once we filter out the really bad data (as we saw last class, we had already done that with these data!) then those quality lines may be unnecessary and could slow down processes (as it duplicates the amount of lines in our text file). The `fasta` format, which is much more widely used, looks like this: 


![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/fasta.png?raw=true)

See how the main difference among these two file formats is simple: **eliminate two lines**. So, how could we do this using the command line? 

One really good tool that is very helpful for this task is `sed`, which we talked about a bit in class, but not in too much detail. [Here is a super helpful `sed` tutorial for linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-basics-of-using-the-sed-stream-editor-to-manipulate-text-in-linux), which has a couple of really important tips for what we need. 

You can also do this with `awk` (though the code is a little messier) and with `grep` and `cut` (the last of which we have not seen in class, but you could look into and see how it can be added to your code). Remember that the pipe `|` is a major tool for streaming these file editors into one, and that you should use some **output redirection** so that not all the output is printed onto the screen (As in, save the fasta output to a different file). There are MANY ways to write code for this task... so feel free to be creative about it :)

## Thursday pm: Intro to programming and python


First, let's talk a bit about programming languages, their history, and how python fits into it all - why is it the most popular? Is it the best one? 



![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/programming-languages.jpg?raw=true)


Now, let's talk about python. There are two general things we can do with python: 

- create and/or execute python programs in the shell

- execute and compute tasks within python

>Here is a good example of the ***"why python?"*** question from above:

## Creating and executing your first program in python

So, let's first create a short little program. First, let's start by checking if you have `python3` installed and where, by typing: 

```bash
which python3
```

Now, this gives us the path we need to create our program, which will look something like this: 

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello, snow!") #you can add the message of your choice :) 
```

> So, first create your file called `hello.py` using `touch`, and then open the file using `nano` text editor in the shell and type all of the above - being careful to add the correct path to python3. Make your file executable using `chmod +x` and now you can finally execute your program by typing: 

```bash 
./hello.py
``` 


## Performing computations within python and learning python basics (variables and objects)


Before we play around with some computations in `python`, let's talk about variables for a bit. 

In general there are four main variable types, as is portrayed in the **Haddock&Dunn book, chapter 7**: 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/variable-types.png?raw=true)


Variables can also be organized into lists (or more generally arrays) or dictionaries. Lists are ordered, such that you can access items in the list simply by the order they are in (example: print item #75 in this list). However, values/items in a dictionary can be accessed through the associated keys (so, they are unordered) 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/lists-dictionaries.png?raw=true)


> For more details and information on these basics of programming, please refer to the excellent **book chapter form Haddock&Dunn #7**, specifically pages 105–115 (*we will talk about the rest of the chapter next week*). 

Now with these basics, let's move along to perform some computations and make some basic objects within the python interactive shell. For that, we will be using [this tutorial from **software carpentry**](https://swcarpentry.github.io//python-novice-inflammation/01-intro.html). 


## Assignment for week 6/7

This assignment is due on **Tuesday Feb. 25th** by class start time, though if you need a bit more time you can also turn it in on thursday (by the latest). 


The assignment is to work through the **Haddock&Dunn Chapter 8, pages 125–140**. With the following caveats/changes: 

- The final `dnacal.py` program should delete everything that is not necessary for executing the tasks.

- I also want you all to use the twentieth (!!) sequence from the `Bjimenezi_Churi2.fq` file (you can use a series of two commands, with `head | tail` to achieve this easily :) to do the final calculation.

- I need you to submit both the final program, as well as the output you got from it, based on the sequence that is mentioned above. 


> Please turn in this assignment using [this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16mADKBzIJVfTayAA8Xh2fpZcnWwI2u5P?usp=drive_link), you can submit two documents if necessary, one for the code used and one for the program.
