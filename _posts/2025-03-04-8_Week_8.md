# Week 8 | Python pt. 3

------------
This week we are getting into conditional statements (`if` and `if-else`) and the loops (`for` and `while`). Let's talk about each one and go into examples. 


## The "for" and "while" loops

We had already seen a `for-loop` a couple of weeks ago... can you recall? Let's revisit this and then see how `for-loops` work in `python`. 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/for-while-loops.png?raw=true)

In python, you can do `forloop` operations on lists or on strings (operating on each character). The format is as follows (notice the indents): 
 
```python 
for EachItem in MyCollection: #must add a colon at end of statement line
	execute command
	print ("something")
resume operation of main commands #the "code block" ends with the indents
``` 


Let's do a short for loop in the interactive prompt: 

```python 
for count in range(0, 5):
	print(count)
```


**We are going to write a second program** in `python` today (*this program will be part of the thursday lab assignment so make sure you save your work*), so start by creating a new text file called `proteincalc.py`, remember to add the first line to the file indicating where it should be executed, and then begin your program: 

```python
ProteinSeq = "FDILSATFTYGNR"
for AminoAcid in ProteinSeq: 
	print (AminoAcid)
```

Now save this file, and execute it from the command line. What output do you get? Did it work, or do you need to do something additional to it?

>Although the `while` loops are less commonly used, they are definitely widely useful for many computation and estimation programs, as is craftfully demonstrated in this **[short youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkHWPAHS5c0), which is also quite useful for preparing you on how to organize code** based on tasks and goals for your final projects!
>
>**Additional**: if you feel like the lecture is going slow... how about re-creating the while loop from the video? And how about re-doing the first for-loop from above (`range (0,5,)`) but instead do this with a `while-loop`? :)

## The if, else, and elif statements

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/if-else-statements.png?raw=true)


The **if statement** is the most widely used in programming to logically separate operations based on conditions of your data. The format in python is as follows: 

```python
if logical condition == True: 
	do this command
	then this other command
continue with normal commands
```

In many cases, the `if` statement works best if joined with an `else` statement. Let's go again to the interactive prompt to do the following operations, which will define a very simple function called `check_number` that receives a prompt and returns output that indicates whether the number was positive, negative, or zero. 

> **NOTE: Please keep in mind, when writing the code below, that for every conditional statement another indent must be added!!**

```python
def check_number(num): #defines the function check_number
    if num > 0:
        print("Positive")
    elif num < 0:
        print("Negative")
    else:
        print("Zero")
```
Now, enter various numbers using `check_number(564)` in the prompt. Does it work? 

## Assignment part 1


Now, let's go back to our first python program, `dnacalc.py`, and add some lines of code to it to perform some new calculations based on the new tools we have at hand. 

**ADDITION 1:** After the user enters in a sequence and it is error-checked,
check to see if the sequence entered was actually an RNA
sequence, rather than a DNA sequence.  We will assume that any
RNA sequence will include the character 'U'.  If it is an RNA
sequence, convert the sequence to DNA, tell the user that you
have done so, and then continue with the program.

>Note: `replace` is a simple built-in function for search-and-replace and does not allow for regular expressions.
>Question: which of the above statements or loops should be used to accomplish this task? 
﻿

**ADDITION 2:** Calculate T_m for the sequence, using the formula appropriate
for the sequence length and report it in a friendly way to the
user.
      
> For this, you need to go through pages 144 – 148 to add the additional lines of code to your program. Make sure you test each line in the interactive prompt to know that it works, and what it does! 
   
> **PLEASE SUBMIT THIS ASSIGNMENT by thursday March 6 @ 8:29am** in [this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sE3qlj_2fTo28ELcjXiI9mz5_2XxDW19?usp=drive_link), so that we can check and continue with progress on python during the thursday morning lecture.

## Thursday pm | Take-home lab activity and assignments

This afternoon, we will be working more on lists and dictionaries, how to access them and how to make them. First, let's start with lists, and let's go straight to the `python3` interactive prompt.

When defining a list, you can simply type: 

	MyList = [33,12,89] #to define a list with three elements, and then
	MyList[1] #is used to access element #1 on the list - which begins with 0

> Note that brackets are important both for defining lists and for accesing items within a list, or **indices**

In python, list indexing is best visualized by placing numbers between
list elements as seen in the figure below.  Haddock & Dunn suggest a
nice way to think about list indexing.  If you have a single number in
the list index, it returns the value to the right of the number.  If
you give a range, python generates a tong that places both ends of the
tongs on the numbers and returns all elements of the list between the
numbers.
﻿
![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/list-indexing.png?raw=true)

A more formal way to think about range indexes is that the number at
the beginning of the range is inclusive and the number at the end of
the range is exclusive. If a number is missing from the range, it means include all elements on that side of the range.  

`[:3]` means start at the beginning of the list and grab until the placeholder 3 

`[3:]` means start at position 3 and take everything to the right.  

`[:]` means the whole list.
﻿


Now let's get some practice. Perform the examples below based on `myList`.  Before you execute the commands, predict what the output should be and see if your predictions match the output.

```python
myList = ['a','b','c','d','e']
	
myList[:]                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                       
myList[:3]                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                       
myList[2:]                                                                                                             
               
myList[-2:]    # a negative index?!                                                                                    
                                                                                                                       
myList[:-2]                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                       
# what is happening with a negative index?     
```

If an additional colon is added at the end of the range of indices, the last value indicates the **step size**, as in, only show me indices that are every `X` number of indices within this range. 

	::1 #this is saying every number
	::2 #this is saying every other number

You can use this also to reverse lists, by adding a negative step: 

```python
::-1
::-2
```

As we saw in tuesday's class, you can use the function `range()` to define a list: 

```python
rangeList = range(0,6)
```

You can also add steps by adding a third parameter: 

	range(1, 10, 2) #try a few other combinations


There's also ways to do things we previously did in the shell, such as `uniq` and `sort`, in python with lists. 

```python
myList = [4,3,6,5,2,9,0,8,1,7]                                                                                         
myList.sort()                                                                                                          
myList                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                       
myList = [4,3,6,5,2,9,0,8,1,7]                                                                                         
newList = sorted(myList)                                                                                               
                                                                                                                       
myList                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                       
newList                       
```

To find the unique elements in a list you can use the function `set`, which you should always run within a `list` command to make sure the output is a list.

```python
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'red']                                                     
colors                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                       
list(set(colors))              
```


To check the contents of lists you can use the `in` operator.  *This is
something that could greatly simplify your* `dnacalc.py` *program.*



	myList = range(10,20)                                                                                                  
	myList                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                       
	11 in myList                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                       
	21 in myList                                                                       

Lists and strings are very similar. 

```python
sequenceString = 'ACGTA'                                                                                               
sequenceList   = ['A','C','G','T','A'] 

sequenceString[3]                                                                                                      
sequenceList[3] #are the outputs different? 

'A' in sequenceString

```

Also, you can change a string in to a list with the `list()` command.                                                                    

```python                                                                                                                       
seqListFromString = list(sequenceString) 
seqListFromString                                                                                                                                                          
```

## Assignment part 2

>***Please finish the take-home lab activity (above) prior to starting the assignment.*** 

This assignment has two components - which I believe should not take too much time: 

- First, submit the short program described in page 168 of Haddock&Dunn, and give me short yet descriptive annotations explaining all steps of the code. 

- Second, submit the dictionary of aminoacids described between pages 151–157 of Haddock&Dunn, using the `proteincalc.py` program that we started last tuesday during  class (*it's on page 151 if you need to recreate it*). 

Submit both of these files, or alternatively, submit a single Markdown file which contains your work AND the final full program scripts. Please submit by friday March 6th at the end of the day in [this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mv8oTDZ-OvKaiLLOMdkqFEGBgOBGp7tB?usp=drive_link).
