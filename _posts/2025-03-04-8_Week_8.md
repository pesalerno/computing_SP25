# Week 8 | Python pt. 3

------------
This week we are getting into conditional statements (`if` and `if-else`) and the loops (`for` and `while`). Let's talk about each one and go into examples. 


## The "for" and "while" loops

We had already seen a `for-loop` a couple of weeks ago... can you recall? Let's revisit this and then see how `for-loops` work in `python`. 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/for-while-loops.png?raw=true)

In python, you can do `forloop` operations on lists or on strings (operating on each character). The format is as follows (notice the indents): 
 
```python 
for EachItem in MyCollection: #must add a colon at end of statement line
	execute command
	print ("something")
resume operation of main commands #the "code block" ends with the indents
``` 


Let's do a short for loop in the interactive prompt: 

```python 
for count in range(0, 5):
	print(count)
```


**We are going to write a second program** in `python` today (*this program will be part of the thursday lab assignment so make sure you save your work*), so start by creating a new text file called `proteincalc.py`, remember to add the first line to the file indicating where it should be executed, and then begin your program: 

```python
ProteinSeq = "FDILSATFTYGNR"
for AminoAcid in ProteinSeq: 
	print (AminoAcid)
```

Now save this file, and execute it from the command line. What output do you get? Did it work, or do you need to do something additional to it?

>Although the `while` loops are less commonly used, they are definitely widely useful for many computation and estimation programs, as is craftfully demonstrated in this **[short youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkHWPAHS5c0), which is also quite useful for preparing you on how to organize code** based on tasks and goals for your final projects!

>**Additional**: if you feel like the lecture is going slow... how about re-creating the while loop from the video? And how about re-doing the first for-loop from above (`range (0,5,)`) but instead do this with a `while-loop`? :)

## The if, else, and elif statements

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/if-else-statements.png?raw=true)


The **if statement** is the most widely used in programming to logically separate operations based on conditions of your data. The format in python is as follows: 

```python
if logical condition == True: 
	do this command
	then this other command
continue with normal commands
```

In many cases, the `if` statement works best if joined with an `else` statement. Let's go again to the interactive prompt to do the following operations, which will define a very simple function called `check_number` that receives a prompt and returns output that indicates whether the number was positive, negative, or zero. 

> **NOTE: Please keep in mind, when writing the code below, that for every conditional statement another indent must be added!!**

```python
def check_number(num): #defines the function check_number
    if num > 0:
        print("Positive")
    elif num < 0:
        print("Negative")
    else:
        print("Zero")
```
Now, enter various numbers using `check_number(564)` in the prompt. Does it work? 

## Assignment part 1


Now, let's go back to our first python program, `dnacalc.py`, and add some lines of code to it to perform some new calculations based on the new tools we have at hand. 

**ADDITION 1:** After the user enters in a sequence and it is error-checked,
check to see if the sequence entered was actually an RNA
sequence, rather than a DNA sequence.  We will assume that any
RNA sequence will include the character 'U'.  If it is an RNA
sequence, convert the sequence to DNA, tell the user that you
have done so, and then continue with the program.

>Note: `replace` is a simple built-in function for search-and-replace and does not allow for regular expressions.
>Question: which of the above statements or loops should be used to accomplish this task? 
﻿

**ADDITION 2:** Calculate T_m for the sequence, using the formula appropriate
for the sequence length and report it in a friendly way to the
user.
      
> For this, you need to go through pages 144 – 148 to add the additional lines of code to your program. Make sure you test each line in the interactive prompt to know that it works, and what it does! 
   
> **PLEASE SUBMIT THIS ASSIGNMENT by thrusday March 6 @ 8:29am** in [this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sE3qlj_2fTo28ELcjXiI9mz5_2XxDW19?usp=drive_link), so that we can check and continue with progress on python during the thursday morning lecture.
