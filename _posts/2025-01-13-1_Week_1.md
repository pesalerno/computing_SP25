# Week 1 | Intro to class and starting with shell

------------
>Week's goals:
>
>- making sure the computer runs properly
>
>- understanding the computer, what is a GUI/API
>
>- opening/running the shell, making a directory and downloading the course's github repository


--------------

>**GENERAL COURSE FORMAT:** Because there is no exam for this course, the bulk of the grade is weekly assignments, and the final project. Thus, make sure you keep up with assignments and coursework, weekly. 
>A general week will look like this:
>- TUESD 8:30am | Short lecture/easy coding
>- THURS 8:30am | Intro to lab assignment - or - Reading discussion
>- THURS 1:45pm | Hands-on coding, work through assignment
>

----------------


GETTING SET UP
-------

The first week of the course, we will need to set up the following software: 

1. **A simple Text Editor**. It is crucial that you ALWAYS use the correct text editors when coding. There are many options, here are some I like: 
- [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) for Mac
- [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) for Windows 


2. **A Markdown editor**. Although I will not require you to use this for the first two weeks, starting on week 3 you will have to turn in all assignments in markdown format. So, the sooner you
become familiar with this **VERY SIMPLE TO LEARN** language, the better. Some options: 
- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for Mac
- [markdownpad](http://markdownpad.com/) for PC


3. **BASH/terminal**. This one is tricky... because of different Operating Systems. So, we will focus A LOT of our first week on making sure everyone can run/execute bash/shell on their personal computers. 
Nothing to prep before the class for this, other than with patience. If you have access to a mac or linux computer, this aspect will be easier in terms of installation and execution. 

---------------------------

INTRO TO COMPUTING
-------

First off... what is computing? programming? coding? GUI? API? 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/What-is-an-API.png?raw=true)

In this class, we will focus mostly on coding - some on computing, and a bit on programming. Now, coding is different depending on the operating system. What is an operating system?

STARTING OUT
-------

Now, most of being in the 'shell', or using command-line operations, is about knowing `where` on the computer you are. So, let's get started with a bit of command-line. Open the shell/terminal and type

	pwd

This will tell you *where* you are in your computer. This command is one of the ones that you will most often use. 
>**NOTE:** Every file on your computer has an address; if you are going to do an operation on a file, you need its address, or **path**.
>There are, generally, two types of paths:
>- **absolute/full path** represents the path of a given directory or file beginning at the root directory
> - **relative path** represents the path of a given directory/file relative to the working/current directory
>
>
>For example, say you have a file "my_favorite_file.txt" located in the directory `/Users/myname/Desktop/my_directory`.
>	- the **full path** to this file  is `/Users/myname/Desktop/my_directory/my_favorite_file.txt`
>    - the **relative path** to this file depends on where you are on the computer
>	- if you are calling this file from Desktop, the relative path would be `my_directory/my_favorite_file.txt`
>	- if you are in `/Users/myname/`, the relative path becomes `Desktop/my_directory/my_favorite_file.txt`
>    
>*Whenever you call the full path, you can reach the file from anywhere on your computer. Relative paths will change based on your current location.*



Now, let's create a folder for the course using this command: 

	mkdir computing-SP25-course-content

>**NOTE:** Naming conventions in computing are extremely important... to the point that I now collapse when I see spaces in file names (*even a word document*). 
>NEVER add a space to the names of files or folders (**NEVER!!!!** and avoid all special characters, except `-`, `_`)
	
Now, let's move into the directory we just created using the command `cd`:

	cd computing-SP25-course-content
	
	
Now to practice, let's try to make a few additional directories, such as for the `course-website`, `data`, `assignments`, and `readings`. We'll see the files we made using the command `ls`:

	ls -ltr
	
>**Question**: what did the flag `-ltr` do to our command? What happens if you type `man ls`? 


### Commonly used commands 

Here are some commands you will use all the time, we will go back to them all semester

Command | Translation | Examples
--------|-------------|---------
`cd` | **c**hange **d**irectory | `cd /absolute/path/of/the/directory/` <br> Go to the home directory by typing simply  `cd` or `cd ~` <br> Go up (back) a directory by typing `cd ..`
`pwd` | **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory | `pwd`
`mkdir` | **m**ake **dir**ectory | `mkdir newDirectory` creates newDirectory in your current directory <br> Make a directory one level up with `mkdir ../newDirectory`
`cp` | **c**o<b>p</b>y | `cp file.txt newfile.txt` (and file.txt will still exist!)
`mv` | **m**o<b>v</b>e | `mv file.txt newfile.txt` (but file.txt will *no longer* exist!)
`rm` | **r**e<b>m</b>ove | `rm file.txt` removes file.txt <br> `rm -r directoryname/` removes the directory and all files within
`ls` | **l**i<b>s</b>t | `ls *.txt` lists all .txt files in current directory <br> `ls -a` lists all files including hidden ones in the current directory <br> `ls -l` lists all files in current directory including file sizes and timestamps <br> `ls -lh` does the same but changes file size format to be **h**uman-readable <br> `ls ../` lists files in the directory above the current one
`man` | **man**ual | `man ls` opens the manual for command `ls` (use `q` to escape page)
`grep` | **g**lobal **r**egular <br> **e**xpression **p**arser |  `grep ">" seqs.fasta` pulls out all sequence names in a fasta file <br> `grep -c ">" seqs.fasta` counts the number of those sequences <br> 
`cat` | con<b>cat</b>enate | `cat seqs.fasta` prints the contents of seqs.fasta to the screen (ie stdout)
`head` | **head** | `head seqs.fasta` prints the first 10 lines of the file <br> `head -n 3 seqs.fasta` prints first 3 lines
`tail` | **tail** | `tail seqs.fasta` prints the last 10 lines of the file <br> `tail -n 3 seqs.fasta` prints last 3 lines
`wc` | **w**ord **c**ount | `wc filename.txt` shows the number of new lines, number of words, and number of characters <br> `wc -l filename.txt` shows only the number of new lines <br> `wc -c filename.txt` shows only the number of characters
`sort` | **sort** | `sort filename.txt` sorts file and prints output
`uniq` | **uniq**ue | `uniq -u filename.txt` shows only unique elements of a list <br> (must use sort command first to cluster repeats)
