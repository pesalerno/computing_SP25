GETTING SET UP
-------

The first week of the course, we will need to set up the following software: 

1. **A simple Text Editor**. It is crucial that you ALWAYS use the correct text editors when coding. There are many options, here are some I like: 
- [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) for Mac
- [jEdit](https://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download) for Windows 


2. **A Markdown editor**. Although I will not require you to use this for the first two weeks, starting on week 3 you will have to turn in all assignments in markdown format. So, the sooner you
become familiar with this **VERY SIMPLE TO LEARN** language, the better. Some options: 
- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for Mac
- [markdown-tools](https://github.com/igormironchik/markdown-tools/actions/runs/12670484709) for PC


3. **BASH/terminal**. This one is tricky... because of different Operating Systems. So, we will focus A LOT of our first week on making sure everyone can run/execute bash/shell on their personal computers. 
Nothing to prep before the class for this, other than with patience. If you have access to a mac or linux computer, this aspect will be easier in terms of installation and execution.
