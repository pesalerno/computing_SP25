# Week 3 | More coding in bash

------------

>Week's goals:
>
>- getting more comfortable with coding in the shell environment
>
>- understand the use of pipe (sequences of commends)

## Creating and editing files in the shell

First, let's play around a bit with two programs, `touch` and `nano`. The first one essentially does nothing but create a blank file. 

```bash
	touch blank-test-file.txt 
```

Then, we can edit the file typing `nano` and then the file name. This will get us into the program `nano`, which looks like this:

Now, let's add five taxa of your choice in various repetitions, and up until around 20 entries, kind of like this: 

```bash
	raven
	raven
	flower
	tree
	flower
	raven
	raven
```

> ...but more :) 


Now, let's play around a bit with `sort` and `uniq`, two simple programs in `shell`. First, let's `sort` the entries, so that all repeated entries are one next to the other (so, order alphabetically). Then, let's use the pipe `|` to add the command `uniq` and have keep only the unique entries from this list. 

```bash
	sort filename.txt | uniq 
```
	
Finally, let's save these entries to a file using `>`, and check your work using `cat`.
