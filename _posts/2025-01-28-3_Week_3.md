# Week 3 | More coding in shell

------------

>Week's goals:
>
>- getting more comfortable with coding in the shell environment
>
>- understand the use of pipe (sequences of commands)
>

--------------


## Creating and editing files in the shell

First, let's play around a bit with two programs, `touch` and `nano`. The first one essentially does nothing but create a blank file. 

```bash
	touch blank-test-file.txt 
```

Then, we can edit the file typing `nano` followed by the file name. This will get us into the program `nano`, which looks like this:

Now, let's add five taxa of your choice in various repetitions, and up until around 20 entries, kind of like this: 

```bash
	raven
	raven
	flower
	tree
	flower
	raven
	raven
```

> ...but more :) 


Now, let's play around a bit with `sort` and `uniq`, two simple programs in `shell`. First, let's `sort` the entries, so that all repeated entries are one next to the other (so, order alphabetically). 

```bash
sort filename.txt
```

Then, let's use the pipe `|` to add the command `uniq` and have keep only the unique entries from this list. 

```bash
sort filename.txt | uniq 
```
	
Finally, let's save these entries to a file using `>`, and check your work using `cat`. 


## PART II: Learning `awk` basics

The program/language `awk` is widely used and considered a very powerful tool for transforming large data files using the command line. The general syntax of `awk` commands is as follows;

```bash
awk options 'selection_criteria {action}' input-file > output-file
```

>What `awk` does is: 
>
>1. **scans** the input file line by line, 
>2. **splits** each line into fields, 
>3. **compares** lines/fields to pattern, and 
>4. performs **action**(s) on matched lines

Here is another way to think about it: 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/awk-syntax.png?raw=true)

OK, now before go into `awk`, let's learn about `echo`, which is a simple program that prints to screen what you add as arguments: 

```bash
	echo "Hello World"
	#every computing class I've ever seen usually begins with this phrase!
```

Now, let's try to construct a small sequence of words using `echo` so that we can then use `awk` with it.

```bash
echo -e "Call\nTall\nBall" 
```
> Question: what happens if you don't add the `-e` argument? What does it do?

Now, let's use `awk` in a very simple manner and using the `pipe`: 

```bash
echo -e "Call\nTall\nBall" | awk '/[CT]all/'
```

This command finds names from the echo list that match the pattern "all" but only contain C and T.
>
>-------
>
>What does it print out? 
>
>-------
>

You can also do almost the exact same command as above, but for excluding those matched patterns: 

```bash
echo -e "Call\nTall\nBall" | awk '[^CT]all/'
```

You can also match according to spelling differences or errors in data files, by adding a `?` to the code. For example: 

```bash 
echo -e "Colour\ncolor" | awk '/Colou?r/'
```

Which should **match zero or one occurence of the character preceding `?`** (so matches and prints both). 

> Question: why isn't the above code working? Why is it only printing one, not both? Can you fix it to make it work?
> 

Now, let's say you have this data: 

```bash
echo -e "01\n001\n0001\n02\n0003\n004"
```

And you want to capture all the fields/lines that have any number of zeros following by 1, then you use **`+` which captures one or more occurences of `0`**: 


```bash
echo -e "01\n001\n0001\n02\n0003\n004" | awk '/[+0]1/'
```

> Question: how would I modify the above code if my data looks like this: 
> 
> 		echo -e "10\n1000\n100\n02\n3000\n400\n1\n300\n100\n10"
>
> and I want to be able to capture all the numbers that start with 1
>
>
<Did you capture the number `1`> 
  <summary>Did you capture the number `1`? <summary>
  OK, so we weren't able to capture the number `1` in the above code, and that's because we would need `*` to be able to match zero or more occurences of the number `0`. Try that instead and see how it goes. <br> 
  
</Did you capture the number `1`> 




>Now, let's `sort` those entries, keep only the `uniq` numbers, and export into a file called `unique-numbers.txt`. Then do `cat` to make sure it worked. 
>> Show me both your final line of code (or all of them if you want to explain it step by step), make sure you explain what each step is doing, and also show me the result when you `cat` your document.
