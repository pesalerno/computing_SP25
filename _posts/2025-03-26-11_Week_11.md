**Explanation on expectations for the code and paper.**

This submission is, mostly, the main `README.md` file that you create when you make a new repository. So, to submit this final assignment, first create a new repository with a README, and within the README.md file you will add all of your code (methods) and what it does (results). Additionally, you will begin your README file with an introduction, and finalize your file with a discussion/conclusion of your protocol, methods, and results. Below is a simple format to follow for your README.md file. 



-------------

> [Here is a template for you to guide the `README.md`](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/project_README_template.md) file, which will be the backbone of your project submission, as well as point breakdown for each aspect. **Follow the template for more details on project expectations and grading breakdown.**
