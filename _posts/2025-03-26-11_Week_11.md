      - (10) Discussion/Conclusions (take aways)

#### **CODE and PAPER: 125 points**


**Explanation on expectations for the code and paper.**

This submission is, mostly, the main `README.md` file that you create when you make a new repository. So, to submit this final assignment, first create a new repository with a README, and within the README.md file you will add all of your code (methods) and what it does (results). Additionally, you will begin your README file with an introduction, and finalize your file with a discussion/conclusion of your protocol, methods, and results. Below is a simple format to follow for your README.md file. 



-------------

> [Here is a template for you to guide the `README.md`](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/project_README_template.md) file, which will be the backbone of your project submission, as well as point breakdown for each aspect. **Follow the template for more details on project expectations and grading breakdown.**

## HTML basics 

`html` is the basic language of the web - although there's already been a few versions of it, it has remained mostly the same since its beginnings. Nowadays, websites are made of html base, together with CSS and JavaScript for more complex interactive graphics and pop-ups. HTML is a 'markup' language, meaning you have to mark up all the text with code. Today, we'll do a couple of basics of html, and this will help us better undertand why `markdown` has taken over web formatting - as it is easily translated into html code, and much more human readable! 

- First, [look through this video](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/pt/html-basics) and try to recreate the code. [Use this html editor to have a live preview](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editor.asp) of what your code looks like formatted (after you get to the link, click on ***"try it yourself"*** to get started). As you work on this exercise, try to come up with whatever theme you may like to make a very simple website (anything from your projects/SMPs, to a personal hobby), just as the one on the example. 

> The code at the beginning of the video (the blank webpage) for starting is the following: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>New Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body>


	</body>
</html>
```


- Second, [watch this video](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/pt/html-lists) and incorporate this code into your html file.

- Third, finish your website adding the components on the two videos you watched, adding just a bit of info on whatever subject you may like, and [submit your code as an `.html` file to this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1htDZgc4na6SOdjmm53no7lgWDdAjegJw?usp=drive_link) - so, when you are done with the online live preview editor, you can just copy/paste that on a blank text document on your computer as save it as `filename.html`

>> You can submit this document by tuesday of next week, April 8th, or anytime sooner if you wish :) 
>> 
>> ***Happy coding!***
