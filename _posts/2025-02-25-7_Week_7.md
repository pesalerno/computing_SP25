# Week 7 | Python pt. 2

------------

## Tuesday am: Checking read quality of Illumina data

Let's try to download and install `fastqc`, a program very commonly used as a first step to look into Illumina (or similar next-gen platform) data and try to infer quality of the "run" and library prep. 

First, let's make sure that your linkux machine is up-to-date: 

```bash 
sudo apt update
```

Then, let's try to install fastqc: 

```bash
sudo apt -y install fastqc 
```

To confirm that fastqc has been installed correctly: 

```bash
fastqc --help 
```
And finally, let's run fastqc for all our data files! (For this to work, you either need to be within the folder where your fastq files are located, or add the full/relative path).

```bash
fastqc --noextract -t 2 -o fastqc *fastq.gz
	#did this work correctly for running it on all of your files? where are the output files saved?
```
