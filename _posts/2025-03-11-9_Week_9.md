# Week 9 | Python pt. 4

------------
Week's goals: 

- heavy coding (python) in-class and in-lab
- assignment from tuesday to thursday


--------------

## TUES am | More about functions 


> We had previously seen functions (*remember the example*?) in `python`, so today let's talk a bit more in-depth about how they are constructed, as they are an integral part of programming. 

A function is what is called a **compound statement** in python, such that it needs more than one line of code: 


```python
# defining a function that prints "Hello"
def func():
    print("Hello")

# calling the function    
func()
```
> Can you recall other examples of **compound statements** we've seen using `python` during class?

### The simplest function

The simplest function would be one that does nothing, such as with the statement `pass`: 

```python
def fn():
	pass
fn()
```

### Return 

Most functions have a `return` statement within them, which essentially executes the function described above. 

```python
def add(a, b):

    # returning sum of a and b
    return a + b


# calling function
add(2, 3)

#storing the result into a variable
res = add(2, 3)
print(res)
```
Let's take a closer look at each component: 

![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/functions-return.png?raw=true)


### Composing functions

>In the example below, we generate a function that... ***does what***? 

```python
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
print('Current temperature in celsius is:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
```

Now, let's say we are interested in generating a function that can transform between farenheit and kelvin. Because it's easier to transform between celsius and kelvin, we can make use of the function we had before, and add another one: 


```python
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0))

#then compose the two functions

def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

#let's test our function: 
fahr_to_kelvin(212.0)

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))

temp_kelvin = fahr_to_kelvin(212.0)
print('temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_kelvin)
```

>>-----------------
>>
>>It's important to understand the difference between **global** and **local variables** - *anything within a function is local and ceases to exist after the function is done executing!*
>>
>>--------------

>-------------
>
>**SHORT ASSIGNMENT:** create a function that calculates and returns the area of a circle given the parameter `radius` (area = 3.1415926535 * radius * radius). Test this function with radius 12 (area = 452.38934), and save it like an executable program that takes user input. Submit the short program using [this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OlcIos8kfTHMFNrLUM22_49JTBV0NIfo?usp=drive_link).

# Thursday am 

### Talk about final projects | expectations and guidelines

We will discuss this during class, to better prepare you for next week's proposal pitches. 

### Talk about prior assignments 

We will briefly to an overview of how you all have progressed and done throughout the semester, and you will all briefly present submissions (that I chose previously) of all the weeks this semester. 


## Installing common biocomputing modules

One of the strongest things about python is the amount of contributors, particularly in the natural sciences, that create modules and libraries that facilitate our lives with commonly used functions and properties!!

### Installing modules

Let's start by setting up your virtual environment using `venv`, which creates a "virtual" isolated Python installation:

```bash
python -m venv .venv 
#you should create the virtual environment within your "project folder" (in this case, wherever you are keeping the course files) and in a folder called `.venv`. 
source .venv/bin/activate
#this previous command activates this environment and makes these executables available within your path. 
which python #check if the virtual environment install worked
```

> NOTE: when you are ready to leave the virtual you can either type `deactivate` in the command line, or you can close the `shell` window you are working on. 

Now we can use `pip`or `python3-pip` to install the modules: 

```bash
#first, start by verifying that pip is installed, and updating just in case 
python -m pip install upgrade pip
python -m pip --version

#then, let's install both modules with pip (*run each line of code separately*): 
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install pandas
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install biopython
```
>***NOTE: the above modules/libraries will only be installed within your `venv` version of python!***

# Thursday pm | NumPy

The package `numpy` is one of the most widely used in data science. This is because it does many operations that `python` can do, but faster and more efficiently. However, and as always, the more specialized something is, the more limited it is. A few of the basic things to know about `numpy` are: 

- The focus is on mathematical/statistical computations and other operations (sort, slice, reshape) of **multidimensional arrays**

- Unlike in `python`, where arrays can be of different data types, the `ndarray` object has to have homogeneous data types

- `numpy` works not only in `python` but also in `C`, which bypasses the needs for many (computationally costly) for loops and iterations for performing matrix/array operations. 

- it has many built-in mathematical and statistical functions incorporated

- unlike python, once created, arrays cannot be changed in size/shape

>For much more information and details of `numpy` capabilities, here is the official [`numpy` user guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html) (*so much stuff!!*) -> let's look at a simple example of why numpy is so powerful for these types of operations

## In-class NumPy exercise

Now, let's get some hands-on experience and also talk a bit about how the axes and dimensions work in an `ndarray` object. Here is an array of two axes, the first of length 2 and the second axis has a length of 3: 

	
	[[1., 0., 0.],
 	[0.,1.,2.]]

> NOTE that arrays in standard `python` are not the same as arrays in `numpy`



Let's run these lines of code and see what they output: 

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
a
a.shape
a.ndim
a.dtype.name
a.size
type(a)

b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1])
b.dtype

np.arange(10, 30, 5)
np.arange(0, 2, 0.3)  # it accepts float arguments
```
>**NOTE:** a common error is to omit the `[]` in the code, which mistakenly tells numpy that the nparray has many arguments, instead of a single sequence of objects.
>

Creating empty/baseline arrays in numpy is very easy: 

```python
np.zeros((3, 4))
np.ones((2, 3, 4), dtype=np.int16)

np.empty((2, 3)) 
```

Creating arrays of different dimensions: 

```python
a = np.arange(6)                    # 1d array
print(a)
b = np.arange(12).reshape(4, 3)     # 2d array
print(b)
c = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)  # 3d array
print(c)
```
And finally - matrix operations are the reason `numpy` is very "***elegant***": 

```python
a = np.array([20, 30, 40, 50])
b = np.arange(4)
b
c = a - b
c
b**2
10 * np.sin(a)
a < 35
```
![](https://github.com/pesalerno/computing_SP25/blob/main/_files/numpy-operations.png?raw=true)


You can also easily slice arrays:

```python
a = np.floor(10 * rg.random((2, 12)))
a
# Split `a` into 3
np.hsplit(a, 3)
# Split `a` after the third and the fourth column
np.hsplit(a, (3, 4))
```
In `numpy`, you also have **Broadcasting**, where you want to carry out an operation between an array and a single number - for example, to convert miles to kilometers:

```python
data = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
data * 1.6
```
