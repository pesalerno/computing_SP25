# Week 9 | Python pt. 4

------------
Week's goals: 

- heavy coding (python) in-class and in-lab
- assignment from tuesday to thursday


--------------

## TUES am | More about functions 


> We had previously seen functions (*remember the example*?) in `python`, so today let's talk a bit more in-depth about how they are constructed, as they are an integral part of programming. 

A function is what is called a **compound statement** in python, such that it needs more than one line of code: 


```python
# defining a function that prints "Hello"
def func():
    print("Hello")

# calling the function    
func()
```
> Can you recall other examples of **compound statements** we've seen using `python` during class?

### The simplest function

The simplest function would be one that does nothing, such as with the statement `pass`: 

```python
def fn():
	pass
fn()
```

### Return 

Most functions have a `return` statement within them, which essentially executes the function described above. 

```python
def add(a, b):

    # returning sum of a and b
    return a + b


# calling function
add(2, 3)

#storing the result into a variable
res = add(2, 3)
print(res)
```
Let's take a closer look at each component:

### Composing functions

>In the example below, we generate a function that... ***does what***? 

```python
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
print('Current temperature in celsius is:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
```

Now, let's say we are interested in generating a function that can transform between farenheit and kelvin. Because it's easier to transform between celsius and kelvin, we can make use of the function we had before, and add another one: 


```python
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0))

#then compose the two functions

def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

#let's test our function: 
fahr_to_kelvin(212.0)

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))

temp_kelvin = fahr_to_kelvin(212.0)
print('temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_kelvin)
```

>>-----------------
>>
>>It's important to understand the difference between **global** and **local variables** - *anything within a function is local and ceases to exist after the function is done executing!*
>>
>>--------------

>-------------
>
>**SHORT ASSIGNMENT:** create a function that calculates and returns the area of a circle given the parameter `radius` (area = 3.1415926535 * radius * radius). Test this function with radius 12 (area = 452.38934).

## Installing common biocomputing modules

One of the strongest things about python is the amount of contributors, particularly in the natural sciences, that create modules and libraries that facilitate our lives with commonly used functions and properties!!

### Installing modules

Let's start by installing these packages, which are most commmonly done with the used of the package installer `pip`: 

```bash
#first, start by verifying that pip is installed, and updating just in case 
pip install upgrade pip

#then, let's install both packages with pip (*run each line of code separately*): 
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib

```
